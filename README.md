# VIrusKiller

In my server I see from time to time
some files that cannot be deleted because they used by another proccess.

After quick search - those files related to coin miner.

some of the files contains vbs script, bat scripts, exe files and etc
for example: tools.vbs, x86.exe, 1.bat, 2.bat, secury.exe, sound.mp3 etc.

I'v installed malware and antivirus softwares and none of them detect the .bar, .vbs and .mp3 files.

I saw this code (credit !!!!)

and recreate new project .
